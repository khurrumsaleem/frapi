    \begin{block}{\centering{Notes:}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Two norms of local error are considered. 
                  $L_{\infty}$ produces more accurate solution while $L_2$ generates
                  less number of rejected time steps
            \item Reference solution was obtained with piece-wise time step history because
                  very small sizes are needed in vicinity of a failure moment.
            \item The watched out parameters are cladding/pellet stress, strain and
                  temperature, gap pressure and heat transfer coefficient
        \end{itemize}
