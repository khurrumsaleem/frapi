Recent changes of the 't_fuelrod' class:

1. 'save' was replaced on 'save_bin'

2. 'load' was replaced on 'load_bin'

3. 'accept' was replaced on 'save'. The 'save' function
    copies fuel rod state from common memory block to local memory block

4. Introduced the function 't_fuelrod % load' which store fuel rod state in a local memory block

5. The function 'next' has been modified such that
   the old 'next (dt)' is equivalent to

   load ()   ! copy fuel rod state from local memory to common memory block
   next (dt) ! make time step dt

6. Some names of variables have been modified (in 'get'):
   'cladding hoop strain, %' => 'cladding total hoop strain, %'
   'cladding axial strain, %' => 'cladding total axial strain, %'
   'cladding radial strain, %' => 'cladding total radial strain, %'

7. Removed the functions 'frod_set_tp_cool' and 'frod_set_tp_cool_off'. 
    Instead one should use the function 
    'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 0)' or
    'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 1)'

8. The meaning of 'set_xx_x' function has been changed. 
    Previousely, this function stored the values in a local memory block.
    In the new version it stores the values to the common memory block.
