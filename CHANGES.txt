CHANGES HISTORY:

0010. Changed the name of variables: 
        'thickness of the axial nodes, cm' -> 'axial mesh thickness, cm'

0009. Changed the name of variables: 
        'axial mesh, cm' -> 'axial mesh thickness, cm'
        'gadolinia weight, wt%' -> 'gadolinia weight fraction'

0008. The meaning of 'set_xx_x' function has been changed. 
      Previousely, this function stored the values in a local memory block.
      In the new version it stores the values to the common memory block.

0007. Removed the functions 'frod_set_tp_cool' and 'frod_set_tp_cool_off'. 
      Instead one should use the function 
      'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 0)' or
      'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 1)'

0006. Some names of variables have been modified (in 'get'):
      'cladding hoop strain, %' => 'cladding total hoop strain, %'
      'cladding axial strain, %' => 'cladding total axial strain, %'
      'cladding radial strain, %' => 'cladding total radial strain, %'

0005. The function 'next' has been modified such that
      the old 'next (dt)' is equivalent to

      load ()   ! copy fuel rod state from local memory to common memory block
      next (dt) ! make time step dt

0004. Introduced the function 't_fuelrod % load' which store fuel rod state in a local memory block

0003. 'accept' has been replaced on 'save'. The 'save' function
      copies fuel rod state from common memory block to local memory block

0002. 'load' has been replaced on 'load_bin'

0001. 'save' has been replaced on 'save_bin'
