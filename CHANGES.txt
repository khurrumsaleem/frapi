CHANGES HISTORY:

0011. Changed the 'frapi' memory structure. Every object of 't_fuelrod' class could be run in 
      two modes: 'frapcon' and 'fraptran'. Therefore, there are two distinct memory spaces that
      refered to the 'dfcon' module and to the 'dftran' module. Each of these modules contains its own 
      list of variables which are three times duplicated and wraped into three kinds of memory space.
      The 'kernel' memory space is common for all fuel rod objects and is used for calculation. 
      The 'working' memory space corresponds to each fuel rod objects. It is used as a storage of 
      the fuel rod variables for current state. The 'backup' memory space is for storing of a
      previous state of fuel rod object. When one calls the 'init' or 'next' subroutines, 1) the 
      'working' variables are copied into the 'kernel', 2) calculations occur, 3) the 'kernel'
      variables are copied back into the 'working' variable space.

      In order to exchange the data between different memory spaces, six functions have been developed:
      copy_k2r : from 'kernel' to 'working'
      copy_r2k : from 'working' to 'kernel'
      copy_r2b : from 'working' to 'backup'
      copy_b2r : from 'backup' to 'working'
      copy_r2f : from 'working' to a binary file
      copy_f2r : from a binary file to 'working'

0010. Changed the name of variables: 
        'thickness of the axial nodes, cm' -> 'axial mesh thickness, cm'

0009. Changed the name of variables: 
        'axial mesh, cm' -> 'axial mesh thickness, cm'
        'gadolinia weight, wt%' -> 'gadolinia weight fraction'

0008. The meaning of 'set_xx_x' function has been changed. 
      Previousely, this function stored the values in a local memory block.
      In the new version it stores the values to the common memory block.

0007. Removed the functions 'frod_set_tp_cool' and 'frod_set_tp_cool_off'. 
      Instead one should use the function 
      'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 0)' or
      'set_i4_0('ifixedcool', 1)'

0006. Some names of variables have been modified (in 'get'):
      'cladding hoop strain, %' => 'cladding total hoop strain, %'
      'cladding axial strain, %' => 'cladding total axial strain, %'
      'cladding radial strain, %' => 'cladding total radial strain, %'

0005. The function 'next' has been modified such that
      the old 'next (dt)' is equivalent to

      load ()   ! copy fuel rod state from local memory to common memory block
      next (dt) ! make time step dt

0004. Introduced the function 't_fuelrod % load' which store fuel rod state in a local memory block

0003. 'accept' has been replaced on 'save'. The 'save' function
      copies fuel rod state from common memory block to local memory block

0002. 'load' has been replaced on 'load_bin'

0001. 'save' has been replaced on 'save_bin'
